        <p class="description">Abdul Qadeer Khan, NI, HI, FPAS (April 1936 10 October 2021), known as A. Q. Khan,
            was a Pakistani nuclear physicist and metallurgical engineer. He was a key figure in
            Pakistan’s nuclear weapons program and is colloquially known as the"Father of Pakistan's
            atomic weapons program". He is a national hero in Pakistan.An émigré (Muhajir) from
            India who migrated to Pakistan in 1952,Khan was educated in the metallurgical engineering
            departments of Western European technical universities where he pioneered studies in
            phase transitions of metallic alloys, uranium metallurgy,and isotope separation based on
            gas centrifuges. After learning of India's "Smiling Buddha" nuclear test in 1974, Khan
            joined his nation's clandestine efforts to develop atomic weapons when he founded the Khan
            Research Laboratories (KRL) in 1976 and was both its chief scientist and director for many
            years.

            In January 2004, Khan was subjected to a debriefing by the Musharraf administration
            over evidence of nuclear proliferation handed to them by the Bush administration of
            the United States.Khan admitted his role in running a nuclear proliferation
            network only to retract his statements in later years when he leveled accusations
            at the former administration of Pakistan's Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in 1990,
            and also directed allegations at President Musharraf over the controversy in 2008.

            Khan was accused of selling nuclear secrets illegally and was put under house arrest
            in 2004. After years of house arrest, Khan successfully filed a lawsuit against the
            Federal Government of at the Islamabad High Court whose verdict declared his debriefing
            unconstitutional and freed him on 6 February 2009. The United States reacted negatively
            to the verdict and the Obama administration issued an official statement warning that
            Khan still remained a "serious proliferation risk".

            After his death on 10 October 2021, he was given a state funeral
            at the National Mosque of Pakistan, Faisal Mosque before being buried
            at the H-8 graveyard in Islamabad, The Capital of Pakistan.
